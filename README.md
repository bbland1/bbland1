# hi i'm brianna (she/her) ✌🏽
### a full-stack web developer 
##### *student at The London App Brewery's complete web development bootcamp*

Coding was always something I told myself it would be cool to learn. I would dabble here and there but in 2022 I just went for it actually trying to learn. While it feels too much to say enjoyed every minute (*Stack OverFlow at 3 am would argue no enjoyment was there...just the focus of someone mad that they can find the right search term*) I haven't stopped coming back to the editor to try another problem or fix and issue I never thought I could figure out. It's been a journey that I am glad I am on.

- 👩🏽‍💻 curently working on: a [to-do list](https://github.com/bbland1/To-Do-List) and a simple [blog](https://github.com/bbland1/blog) for bootcamp. these are both just the first version as we learn to connect database and more. I also like to work through a few of the Codecademy Full-stack Path, and I'm working on some more JavaScript pactice there.

- 💻 currently learning: MongoDB & Mongoose, are the next steps!

- ✅ recently completed: just finished up a [newsletter sign-up](https://royal-donair-54847.herokuapp.com/) page using mailchimp ([github repo](https://github.com/bbland1/newsletter-signup))

- 🤝 looking into starting the collaboration/open source channel if anyone has any suggetions!

Some non-code facts:

- i have a BS in Chemistry 👩🏽‍🔬🧪

- my dogs are the best ❤️

- watching movies/ anime, playing video games, or reading manga are probably my favorite past times
