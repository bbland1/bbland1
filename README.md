# hi i'm brianna (she/her) ‚úåüèΩ

Coding was always something I told myself it would be cool to learn. I would dabble here and there but in 2022 I just went for it actually trying to learn. While it feels too much to say enjoyed every minute (*Stack OverFlow at 3 am would argue no enjoyment was there...just the focus of someone mad that they can find the right search term*) I haven't stopped coming back to the editor to try another problem or fix and issue I never thought I could figure out. It's been a journey that I am glad I am on.

Some non-code facts:

- i have a BS in Chemistry üë©üèΩ‚Äçüî¨üß™

- my dogs are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è

- watching movies/ anime, playing video games, or reading manga are probably my favorite past times
